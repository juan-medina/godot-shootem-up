class_name Kamikaze
extends BasicEnemy
## Kamikaze Enemy
##
## This enemy will charge to the player when in line of sight

## The state of the kamikaze
enum KamikazeState {
	IDLE,
	SEARCHING_FOR_PLAYER,
	KAMIKAZE,
}

@export var acceleration: float = 15  ## Acceleration when kamikaze state

var _state: KamikazeState = KamikazeState.IDLE  ## The kamikaze state, idle by default


## Called every physics iteration, delta is the elapsed time since the previous call, this is a constant value (FPS independent)
func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
	# if the player is in line of sight, change state to kamikaze and activate turbo
	if _state == KamikazeState.SEARCHING_FOR_PLAYER and super._is_player_on_line_of_sight():
		_state = KamikazeState.KAMIKAZE
		turbo = true

	# if we are in kamikaze state, accelerate, we do not do and elif because if the player is on line of sight
	# we are already in the kamikaze state and we want to accelerate immediately
	if _state == KamikazeState.KAMIKAZE:
		speed += acceleration

	# the basic enemy will calculate the movement
	super._physics_process(delta)


## Called when the enemy enters the screen
func _on_visible_on_screen_notifier_2d_screen_entered() -> void:
	# we are now searching for the player
	_state = KamikazeState.SEARCHING_FOR_PLAYER
	# the basic enemy will need to be called so still handle entering the screen
	super._on_visible_on_screen_notifier_2d_screen_entered()
